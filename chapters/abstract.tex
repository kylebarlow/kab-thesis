The abstract should not be longer than 350 words. The "abstract" field in the ProQuest interface will truncate the abstract if it exceeds this word limit. However, your actual abstract, i.e. the abstract you upload as a pdf within your document) may be as long as you need it to be. The title of your dissertation and your name should appear at the top center of the page. The abstract should include a brief statement of the problem, a description of the methods and procedures used to gather data or study the problem, and a condensed summary of the findings.
