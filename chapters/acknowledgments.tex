\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

This work is dedicated to the following very important people:

To my wife, Malia McPherson. Nothing I've done would have been possible without your love and support.

To my parents and sister, who nurtured my scientific interest and intellectual curiosity.

My scientific work would not have been possible without the advice and support of my mentor, Tanja Kortmme, who has always been an excellent role model, and whose crystal clear communication style and instinct and ability to find interesting and important projects I will continue to strive to emulate throughout my career.

I also acknowledge and appreciate the support of my thesis committee members, Andrej Sali and Jaime Fraser, and the rest of my colleagues in the Kortemme lab.
In particular, Roland Pache, Shane Conch{\'u}ir, Kale Kundert, and James Lucas, who I worked closely with on many projects, and Samuel Thompson, Pooja Suresh, and James Lucas, who were integral in the development of the flex ddG method.

Finally, I must acknowledge the support and friendship of Juan Alfredo PÃ©rez Bermejo, Graham Heimberg, and James Webber, who helped me sequence CODa.
