\chapter{Conclusion}

In my thesis research, I have advanced the ability of computional protein structure prediction and design software to more accurately represent proteins with conformational flexibility using an ensemble-based approach.
This has enabled improved performance in interface \ddg\ calculation.

I look forward to the application of these, and future new methods to come to more exciting areas of research at UCSF and in the broader scientific community.
